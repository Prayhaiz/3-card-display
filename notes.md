in this design I say for the mobile there are 3 divs I'm going to be using. 

my step by step approach to solving this project 
1. I have my container
 this I'm going to use it to give my page space on both sides which is the left and right.

2. then I'm going to be having another div which would be my main wrapper for the project
 this div would serve as a container to make it responsive for mobile and desktop views because I'm going to be using flexbox

3. then I would be using another div to be as the main card that may content would be added

this would contain my title and paragraph and also my button



THINGS TO NOTE CONCERNING THE PROJECT 

I have a a title
I have little content
and I have a button
